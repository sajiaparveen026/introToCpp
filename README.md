## INTRODUCTION TO C PLUS PLUS

->> C++ -> High level language

->> OOP -> Object oriented progamming

-> << = extraction
-> >> = insertion

->> int n = 9;  // It means we are assigning a value to the variable
    here,
    int -> data type
    n -> variable name
    = -> assignment operator
    9 -> value which we store in variable

## Data type
   int -> integer
   void -> it doesnt return anything
   char -> character -> 'u'
   float -> 5.77
   long -> 23207860593285890369
   double -> 56.759827588237475
   string -> "Hello"
   boolean -> true,false

## Operator

1. Arithmetic -> +-*/%
2. Logical -> && || !
3. Relational -> < > <= >= == !=
4. Bitwise -> & ^ -> xor (Where we work with bits 0010100)
5. Ternery -> ?:
6. Others -> Assignment (+= , -= , *=)
             Increment / dec ++ --
             sizeOf
             type of
             
## Relational Operator.     
1.< less than
2.> greater than
3.<= less than or equal to
4.>= greater than or equal
5.== equal to
6.!= not equal

## Assignment Operator -> =
+= add and assign.
-= sub. and assign
*= multiply
/= divide

## Conditional Statements
1. if
2. if else
3. if else if
4. Switch statement

## Loops
